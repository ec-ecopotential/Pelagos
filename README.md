Monitoring Ecosystem Services from Mediterranean Marine Mammals (fin whales and striped dolphins) in the Pelagos Sanctuary

By using Earth Observation (remote along with in situ data) assess the state of the tourism based on whale watching in the Mediterranean by measuring three major types of variables: 

1. Variables assessing the state of the cetacean population in the Mediterranean,  
2. The major drivers of change in their population density (human and ecological e.g. SST changes and impacts of fishing) and  
3. Variables that assess the benefits to the human population living by these areas, like benefits from tourism and whale watching activities.
